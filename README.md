### This repository
Clone this repository for a simple node development environment where you can create a more custom implementation of the library and see the changes.

### Watching changes
Navigate to the `scss` directory from the command line and use `sass --watch index.scss` to automatically compile changes. The singular index.css file that is produced, when minified is suitable for production.

### Overriding Changes
Styling options such as color and font-family are encouraged to be overidden, and will not break the rest of the components.
